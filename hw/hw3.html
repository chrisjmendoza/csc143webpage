        <h1>Homework 3 - 20 points</h1><h2><br>
        The Plusses and Diamonds Fractals<br>
        (Expanding the Model-View 
        with a Controller) </h2>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>Now it's time to make an interactive program, where 
        the user can do something with your software.&nbsp; Your goal is to produce a 
        program that displays the following fractals, shown below at different levels: 
        <p><img height="125" src="hw3\pluses.gif" width="510"><br>
            level 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            level 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            level 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            level 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            etc. 
        <p><img src="hw3\diamonds.gif" width="528" height="146"><br>
            &nbsp; 
        <p>The level 0 pictures are the initial state of our 
            program,&nbsp; just a simple plus sign or a simple diamond displayed. 
        <p>To create the level 1 picture for the plus sign, 
            4 more plus signs are added.&nbsp; Each plus sign is half the size of the original, 
            and added to the 4 line ends of the first shape (the center of a new shape is 
            placed at the end of each line of the first shape).&nbsp; To create level 2,&nbsp; 
            just repeat the process:&nbsp; 12 more plus signs (since there are 12 line ends 
            in level 1) each plus sign is half the size of the ones to be connected to. 
        <p>To create the level 1 picture for the diamond, 4 
            more diamonds of the complementary RGB color are added.&nbsp; The added diamonds 
            are half the size of the original, and centered at the 4 vertices of the first 
            diamond.&nbsp; The RGB complementary color is the color that you get when subtracting 
            the amount of red, green and blue of the original color from 255. To create 
            level 2,&nbsp; just repeat the process:&nbsp; 12 more diamonds, each diamond 
            is half the size of the ones to be connected to and of the complementary RGB 
            color (which is the color of the original diamond).
        <p>When the program starts, the fractals are displayed 
            in the initial state(level 0).&nbsp; Display at least one plus sign and one 
            diamond. Make sure that they don't overlap. Apart from these requirements, you 
            can pick whatever size, color, location you want (Of course, it is better to 
            pick a size so that it is easy to see the subsequent levels.)&nbsp;&nbsp; For 
            each mouse click on a shape, the level&nbsp; will increment or decrement by 
            1 and the display is updated.&nbsp; There should be a reset button as well:&nbsp; 
            when the user clicks on the button,&nbsp; the display goes back to the original 
            state.&nbsp; Finally, the current level number should also be displayed and 
            updated as the user works with the program (see the use of the TextViewer below).
        <p>There will be a limit on the number of levels the 
            user can display.&nbsp; If the size of the shapes to add is less than or equal 
            to 1 pixel, don't add any shape. A dialog box should pop up telling the user 
            that they have reached the maximum level. 
        <p>A dialog box should also pop up if the user wants 
            to decrease the level below 0.
        <h3>Implementation</h3>Changes to the Shape interface and/or the AbstractShape class 
        <br>
        (though these changes are going to be used by the Plus and 
        Diamond classes, they belong in the Shape interface or the AbstractShape class-- 
        that inheritance thing again.) 
        <p>Add 5 new instance variables to store Shape objects.&nbsp; 
            These instance variables are to hold the objects to the North, South, East and 
            West of <i>this shape, and the parent shape of this shape. The parent shape 
            is the shape that was used to create this shape (i.e. to compute its location, 
            size, and color). Note that the parent shape will also be one of the west, east, 
            south and north shapes. All of these fields are null for an initial fractal. 
            Add appropriate get/set methods.&nbsp; If a client passes null to a set method, 
            that's ok.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the client passes in a shape that is not physically 
            in the correct direction (e.g. does not have a center directly to the north 
            of the current center, but wants to be the north shape), or that can't be a 
            parent, throw an exception.&nbsp; It is ok if a get method returns null;&nbsp; 
            this just means that there is no shape currently in that direction or that there 
            is no parent shape.
        <p>Add one method to add a level to a given shape. 
            This method should add shapes only if the size of the shapes to add is greater 
            than 1 pixel. Add another method to remove a level from a shape. If the shape 
            is already at level 0, nothing should happen. You must use recursion for 
            the coding of these methods.
        <p>If you haven't done so in homework 2, provide a 
            toString method for a shape. It should give the type of the shape (Plus or Diamond), 
            the coordinates of the center of the shape, its current full size (note that 
            it changes when levels are added or removed), its color(s) (a diamond may have 
            two colors) and its current level. 
        <p>You don't need to provide any clone method for a 
            shape. If you have programmed a clone method for homework 2, you can remove 
            the method.
        <p>Add any other methods that you think are needed 
            for your implementation.
        <p>Changes to the Diamond and Plus classes 
        <p>The major modification that you have to make should 
            be to the draw method. Recursion will come very handy when rewriting this method.
        <p>Changes to the Model 
        <p>The model needs only to keep track of the shapes 
            initially created since the shapes that are added when increasing the levels 
            are stored within the initial shapes. Just add methods that allow the model 
            to add or to remove a level to a shape. 
        <p>There is also no need to return a deep copy of the 
            list of shapes when sending a message to the model requiring the list of the 
            shapes.
        <h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Controller</h3>Build your controller class(es)&nbsp; to implement the user 
        interface as described above.&nbsp;&nbsp; The controller should handle the mouse 
        clicks of the user and send appropriate messages to the model (namely increase 
        or decrease the level of the shape at the location of the click). We will say 
        that a mouse click is on a shape if it is within its rectangular bounding box 
        (with horizontal and vertical sides). Display two JRadioButtons (see the information 
        about JRadioButton and ButtonGroup on the sun web site) to let the user choose 
        between a level increase and a level decrease. You should have at least one public 
        class that has controller functionality (Like the ButtonListener in the SimEvents 
        example.&nbsp; Don't go overboard using anonymous inner classes.)&nbsp; For the 
        dialog box,&nbsp; see the JOptionPane class.&nbsp; It has some useful static methods. 
        <h3>A Text Viewer</h3>Create a new class that implements DrawingView which 
        is all text based. It should print in the terminal window the information about 
        the shapes as given by the toString method of a shape. This view should be refreshed 
        only if the model changes. For example, a mouse click outside of any shape should 
        not print again the list of the shapes. 
        <h3>Class with the main method</h3>Here is where you put all the classes together Model, View, 
        and Controller. This is the class that can also create the two radio buttons and 
        the reset button. Use a JButton for the reset button. 
        <p>Advice 
        <ul>
            <li>Make changes incrementally and test along they 
                way.&nbsp; Also, draw pictures, do pseudocode design, draw UML diagrams, plan, 
                plan, plan. 
            <li>Keep a clean separation between the model, the 
                view and the controller.&nbsp;</li><li>Make sure that you throw appropriate exceptions 
            wherever needed.</li>
            <li>Document all of the methods that you write (use 
                javadoc conventions:, @param, @return, @throw, etc...)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Written Report</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Planning and operation: What does your program 
                do?&nbsp; Describe the major features.&nbsp; 
                If you worked with a partner, how did you divide responsibilities? </li>
            <li>Implementation:&nbsp; How is your program organized?&nbsp; 
                What are the major classes?&nbsp; How do the objects interact? Draw an object diagram.</li>
            <li>Give a clear explanation of the recursive algorithms 
                to add a level to and remove a level from a shape.</li>
            <li>Testing:&nbsp; How did you test your code?&nbsp; 
                What sort of bugs did you encounter?&nbsp; What works and what doesn't?&nbsp; 
                Are there any unresolved problems in the code? </li>
            <li>Evaluate this project: What did you learn from 
                it?&nbsp; Was it worth the effort?&nbsp; This could include things you learned 
                about specifications and interfaces, design issues, Java language or library 
                issues, debugging, etc. </li>
        </ol>
        
        Good Luck and start early!
